                        found to be true by the trier of fact that the attempted murder was willful, deliberate,
                        and premeditated, the person guilty of the attempt shall be punished by imprisonment in the
                        state prison for 15 years to life. Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 2930) of Chapter 7
                        of Title 1 of Part 3 shall not apply to reduce this minimum term of 15 years in state
                        prison, and the
                        person shall not be released prior to serving 15 years’ confinement.</p>
