# AuthoritySpoke

AuthoritySpoke is a Python library for managing structured data about legal rules.

## Learning about AuthoritySpoke

The best way to familiarize yourself with AuthoritySpoke is through the [Introduction to AuthoritySpoke Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mscarey/AuthoritySpoke/blob/master/notebooks/introduction.ipynb).

More documentation is coming soon.

## Installing AuthoritySpoke

I suggest running AuthoritySpoke in a Pipenv environment. See the [installation instructions for Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv).

Then run

```
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```

If everything worked, AuthoritySpoke should be available as a package in your Python environment.

```
$ python
```

```
import authorityspoke
```
