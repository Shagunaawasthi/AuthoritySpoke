## Installing AuthoritySpoke

I suggest running AuthoritySpoke in a Pipenv environment. See the [installation instructions for Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv).

Then run

```
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```

If everything worked, AuthoritySpoke should be available to import in your Python environment.

```
$ python
```

```
import authorityspoke
```
