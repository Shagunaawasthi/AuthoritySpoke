"""
Entity and its subclasses are subclasses of Factor that represent
people, places, or things. Unlike Facts, Evidence, and Allegations
(which are also subclasses of Factor), Entities don't take Predicates
as parameters, so they won't (probably?) need to incorporate
ordered tuples of other Factors.
